    <h3>What is Universal Design?</h3>
    <p>
        Universal Design is a concept that aims to make products and environments accessible and usable by people with
        diverse abilities. It involves designing with the needs of all users in mind from the beginning, rather than
        retroactively adding accessibility features.
    </p>
    <h4>Examples of Universal Design Principles:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Equitable use:</strong> Designing products and environments that are useful and marketable to people
            with diverse abilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexibility in use:</strong> Providing multiple ways for individuals to interact with a product or
            environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple and intuitive:</strong> Designing products and environments that are easy to understand and
            use.</li>
        <li><strong>Perceptible information:</strong> Presenting information in a way that can be easily perceived by
            all users, including those with sensory impairments.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Accessibility design focuses on creating websites that are inclusive and usable by everyone, regardless of their
        abilities or disabilities. It involves implementing practices and techniques that ensure equal access and a
        positive user experience for individuals with various impairments.
